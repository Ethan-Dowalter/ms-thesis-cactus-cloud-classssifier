Abstract:
This study investigates the application of a neural network model for the binary classification of point cloud data into cactus and non-cactus categories, aimed at facilitating
ecohydrological research by simplifying cactus volume and surface area calculations. The
most effective model found used a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, though using a
one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) architecture proved only marginally
less effective. Utilizing a 10-fold cross-validation method, the models demonstrated variable
accuracy and recall across datasets, highlighting the challenges of classifying spatial data,
though both models showed promising results. This approach offers a foundational step
towards leveraging neural networks in environmental studies, demonstrating promise in the
possibility of greatly accelerating the process of measuring columnar cacti on a landscapescale to monitor the health of aridland ecosystems.

This repository contains the published thesis, split up into two parts due to GitHub's upload file size limit, as well as the relevant python code used to generate the models.
